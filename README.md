# Auth2-Microservice-Python

The "Authentication and Authorization as a Service" project is designed to enable organizations to efficiently control and monitor user access to various resources within their systems. Through a structured role- and permission-based access control mechanism, organizations can assign specific permissions to roles and then assign these roles to users. This layered approach ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive endpoints or resources based on predefined rules.

The project offers robust flexibility, allowing administrators to enable or disable users, roles, and permissions as needed, effectively managing access in response to organizational changes. Additionally, the "secure user" feature safeguards critical accounts from accidental deletion, enhancing security for vital user profiles. This service empowers organizations to dynamically manage user access, enforce security policies, and maintain a streamlined, role-based approach to resource management.
